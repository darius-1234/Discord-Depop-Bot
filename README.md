# Discord-Depop-Bot

This is a discord bot that retrieves price information on any product requested by the user by scraping the Depop website. 
Once the bot is up and running, a user can simply send a message on discord to the bot and the bot will return the average, maximum and minimum price along with the standard deviation and number of listings of the product. 
Web scraping is done in depop.py and the bot is run in discordBot.py
